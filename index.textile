h2. Introduction

Madoka is an implementation of the Count-Min sketch, a data structure for summarizing data streams. Madoka uses a conservative update mechanism to improve the accurary of sketches. In addition, Madoka uses an authorized update mechanism and an approximate counting algorithm for ultimate sketching. For more information, see the following web sites.

Madoka was developed as a part of the groonga project ("groonga - An open-source fulltext search engine and column store":http://groonga.org/), special thanks to Brazil Inc.

h2. Installation

h2. Example

<div class="float">
<pre class="code">
#include <iostream>
#include <madoka.h>

int main() {
  madoka::Sketch sketch;
  sketch.create();

  sketch.inc("Madoka", 6);
  sketch.inc("Homura", 6);
  sketch.inc("Homura", 6);

  std::cout << "Madoka: " << sketch.get("Madoka", 6) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Homura: " << sketch.get("Homura", 6) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "Mami: " << sketch.get("Mami", 4) << std::endl;
}
</pre>
</div>

This is an example of using Madoka through its C++ interface. This example creates a sketch with default parameters and then increments values associated with <var>"Madoka"</var> and <var>"Homura"</var>. The example will print <var>"Madoka: 1"</var>, <var>"Homura: 2"</var> and <var>"Mami: 0"</var>.

Madoka supports more operations including file I/O. See "To be written":tbd.html for more details.
